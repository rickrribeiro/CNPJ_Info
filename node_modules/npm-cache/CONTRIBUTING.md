==
Though I have a busy day job, I will do my best to add simple feature requests and
merge PRs as soon as I can. I know this package is not following many of today's best
practices (namely TESTS, a proper branching strategy, and more), but I hope you still
find it useful.

**Important**: Please submit all pull requests to the branch [feature/pull-requests](https://github.com/swarajban/npm-cache/tree/feature/pull-requests)
